Getting Started
===============

Before you can install and use **mokapot**, you'll need to have Python 3.6+
installed. If you think it may be installed, you can check with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 --version

If you need to install Python, we recommend using the `Anaconda Python
distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_. This distribution
comes with most of the **mokapot** dependencies installed and provides the conda
package manager.  

Installation
------------

**mokapot** depends on several Python packages:

- `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_
- `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
- `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
- `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_
- `triqler <https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/triqler>`_


We recommend using `pip` to install **mokapot**. Missing dependencies will also
be installed automatically:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip3 install mokapot


Python API or Command Line Interface (CLI)?
-------------------------------------------
Python is more flexible. CLI runs like other CLI tools.
